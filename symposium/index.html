			<p><em>Summary:</em></p>

			<p>Unlike most neurologic conditions the neuro-biological mechanisms for psychiatric disorders remain unclear. A significant amount of research, obtained using different imaging modalities, has demonstrated structural and functional brain changes related to psychiatric disorders. It is believed that medical imaging seems primed to play a major clinical role in guiding diagnostic and treatment planning decisions in patients with psychiatric conditions.

				<br>
				This symposium is a collaboration between Eindhoven University of Technology, Philips Research, UZ Ghent, and Kempenhaeghe. It aims at bringing together several experts in the field of psychiatric imaging and discuss the state-of-the-art in this area. In particular, the challenges and barriers for the clinical use of medical imaging in psychiatry will be addressed in the light of the future direction of this interesting field.
